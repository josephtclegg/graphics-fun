                <p>When I first tried to make an OpenGL globe, I ended up with something like what you see here.
                No doubt, it has some problems.  Namely the texture is all stretched at the poles: just look at the size
                of Greenland!</p>

                <p>It has to do with how we textured the sphere.  In
                a traditional rendering pipeline, like the one implemented by the WebGL API that we're using
                to run these demos on <i>your</i> GPU, to render a textured 3D object we need: an array of the object's vertices
                in a normalized 3D coordinate space, an array of the (texture) data to accompany each vertex, a shader
                program, and, depending on the rendering mode, an array of indices into the vertex array for the order to tesselate
                triangles from those vertices.  Some other pipeline steps like rasterization or assembling of primitives are left 
                out of the purview of the programmer i.e. 'fixed.'</p>
                <p>This is the model followed by the OpenGL ES standard
                 which WebGL implements in javascript ;)  More modern technologies like Vulkan or, 
                for the web, maybe WebGPU, provide control over all steps of this pipeline but the idea, at 
                least for the purpose of rendering, is the same.  Thus our problem is something to do
                with the vertices, the texture coordinates, or the order we tesselate the triangles.</p>

                <p>More aptly the problem is concerned with all three.  There are many possible aproaches to
                assembling the vertices for a sphere in a normalized 3D coordinate space.  For this example I went with
                the first technique I could think of, perhaps the first you think of as well, the <i>UV-Sphere</i>.
                Building one essentially entails assembling a list of vertices from the intersections of <i>n</i>
                latitudinal <i>stacks</i> and <i>m</i> longitudinal <i>slices</i>, and then tesselating quad-faces
                between every four vertices.  The faces themselves are composed of two triangles sharing two vertices between them.
                A higher or lower fidelity sphere model is achieved by increasing the number of slices/stacks.</p>
                <p>One advantage of
                the UV-sphere is that we can easily texture them from one rectangular bitmap image, by converting a given vertex's
                3D cartesian coordinates to a spherical coordinate system normalized to the 0,1 range.  These spherical coordinates
                may be used to sample the rectangular texture to effectively project the 2D texture onto the 3D sphere.  So really
                the advantage is that, this texture is really easy to deal with, being a 
                rectangular texture, linearly sampled.  There
                are of course drawbacks, namely that this approach does not result in equal-area quads as
                you move through different latitudes of the sphere.  <i>UV distortion</i> is the result of squeezing the
                same-size area from the texture into different-sized areas of the sphere.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="right-column" width="256">
                <p>We can mitigate this issue with techniques like <i>UV unwrapping</i>, which I won't go too far into right now but
                basically the idea is to distort the texture to account for the inherent distortion from projection on to the sphere - 
                but they have caveats too.  Namely, in the case of UV unwrapping, things get complicated when we start trying to do
                procedural geometry, like the demos here.  Really what we need is to rethink how we generate the sphere, and texture it,
                such that we get around this distortion issue.  One idea is to take some basic shape and <i>subdivide</i> it, splitting
                each face into a tesselation of sub-faces of the same basic shape, for some arbitrary number of subdivisions, and then
                extending all the resulting vertices to some distance <i>r</i> representing the radius of the sphere.  As we increase the
                number of subdivisions, the resulting geometry more-closely approximates a sphere of radius <i>r</i>.</p>

                <p>Interestingly, the choice of primitive geometry as a starting point affects the properties of the resulting sphere, at
                least where UV distortion is concerned.  Particularly the distortion is isolated to different regions.  I've included here
                two subdivided-sphere demos starting from different underlying geometries.  Notice the different patterns of distortion in
                each.</p>

                <p>Overall I have to say I love each of them in their own way :)  The UV-sphere's dreamy fisheye distortion of the global
                landmass such that it all but crowds out the oceans is perfect for like, some kind of cute advertisement or clipart with a
                bunch of little guys holding hands, small world or whatever.</p>
                <p>The quadsphere is definitely my favorite toy.  I love the grid-textured version and the distortion pattern
                produced, and the cube earth.  I also want to mention that this one, unlike the icosphere, gave me <i>no issues</i> with texturing,
                it's honestly easier to work with in that regard than the UV-sphere, because I didn't have any issues with seams.  I think there's a
                good case to make that this one is the most practical.</p>
                <p>The icosphere, on the other hand, finally gets us a globe with minimal distortion.  The land masses here look really good,
                way more accurate than the others, at the expense of some stubborn seams and a significant amount of difficulty orienting and texturing
                the thing; your mileage may vary.</p>

                  The phong approach, which results in this nice smooth gummy appearance, just entails taking all of those duplicate
                  normals and averaging them into one, to be used at all instances of that vertex on all faces that it appears in.
                  This way our lighting calculations result in nice smooth shadows rather than many harsh facets.  Thanks Phong!

                <p>
                  Here's a little demo showing the difference between flat-shading vs phong-shading in realtime, on a gummybear.
                  To build this I had to write a parser for .obj models, which turns out to be a bit of a fool's errand if you
                  know anything about the .obj format: it's sparsely documented and has a bunch of nebulous features that may
                  or may not be present in a given model.  Fortunately for my sake this gummybear which I made in blender exported
                  to a relatively simple .obj so I just wrote a parser for what was in the file.  The idea with phong is basically
                  that, our model comes such that each triangular face has three normal vectors, one at each vertex.  When you have
                  a surface/volume like this comprised of a bunch of triangles tiled together, however, you can see that some
                  vertices have different normals for different faces that they are a part of.
